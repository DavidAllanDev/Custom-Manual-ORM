# Custom-Manual-ORM
## A Simple example of a Custom Manual ORM
### Using .net standard 2.0, it's a repository manager that map entities /code manually/ and allow it to have a simple ORM.
#### The initial idea is using  a /database first/ manually implementing a dictionary with <property,database column> and/or a data annotation attibute. and then we are figuring out a way to develop such as a /code first/ and so on.

### Tip: On the Example "DemoClass" instead of using class on name,just use the context such as "Car" or "Customer"

#### Next steps: The idea is to create a cache project and let the Custom-Manual-ORM grow to be albe to let user decide when to cache or not, when to commit its data or not.
#### Next steps: Also to let possible to implement "Unit of work pattern"
