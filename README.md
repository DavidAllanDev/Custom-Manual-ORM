# Custom-Manual-ORM
## A Simple example of a Custom Manual ORM
### Using .NET Core 2.0. It's a repository manager that map entities /code manually/ and allow it to have a simple ORM.
#### The initial idea is using /database first/ manually implementing a dictionary with <property,database column> and then figuring out a way to develop such as a /code first/ and so on.
