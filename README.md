# Custom-Manual-ORM
## A Simple example of a Custom Manual ORM
### Using .net standard 2.0, it's a repository manager that map entities /code manually/ and allow it to have a simple ORM.
#### The initial idea is using /database first/ manually implementing a dictionary with <property,database column> and then figuring out a way to develop such as a /code first/ and so on.

### Tip: On the Example "DemoClass" instead of class on name,just the context such as "Car" or "Customer"

#### Next steps: The idea is to create a cache propject and let the Custom-Manual-ORM to grow to be albe to decide when to cache or not, when to commit its data or not.
#### Next steps: Also to let possible to implement "Unit of work pattern"
