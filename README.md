## A Simple example of a Custom Manual ORM
### Using .NET Core 2.0 I'm creating a repository manager that map entities manually(code manually) and allow to have a simple ORM.
#### The initial idea is using database first manually implementing a dictionary with <property,database column> and then figuring out a way to develop such as a code first and so on.
